# ETL Pipeline with Python and SQL

![Pipeline Diagram](./pipeline-diagram.png) <!-- Replace with your actual PNG file name/path -->

## Overview

This repository demonstrates a robust ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline implemented with Python and SQL. The pipeline is designed to efficiently process, clean, and load data from various sources into a SQL database, enabling seamless data integration and analytics.

## Features

- **End-to-End ETL Workflow**: Extract data from multiple sources, transform it as needed, and load it into SQL tables.
- **Data Cleansing**: Automated routines for cleaning and validating raw data.
- **Modular Design**: Easily extend and customize pipeline components.
- **Error Handling**: Built-in logging and error management for reliable operations.
- **SQL Integration**: Uses T-SQL for efficient data manipulation and storage.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- SQL Server (or compatible database)
- Required Python libraries (see `requirements.txt`)

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/taylorwanyama/ETL-Pipeline-with-Python-and-SQL.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure database connection:**
   - Update the connection details in the configuration file.

4. **Run the pipeline:**
   ```sh
   python etl_pipeline.py
   ```

## How It Works

1. **Extraction**: Pulls raw data from sources (CSV, APIs, etc.).
2. **Transformation**: Cleanses and formats data using Python logic.
3. **Loading**: Inserts processed data into SQL tables with T-SQL scripts.
